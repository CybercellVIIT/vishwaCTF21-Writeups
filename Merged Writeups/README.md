# Merged Writeups
This folder is made for the teams and players that feel more comfortable making a merged writeup file instead of many single files for the problems.

## Folder Structure for Merged Writeups :-
1. Writeups will be added to the 'Merged Writeups' Folder by anyone in the form of the following filetypes(.pdf, .doc, .docx, .txt, .md).
2. Name of the writeup files should be <number>-<Team Name/Username>.<file-extension>
<br>number = The number of the writeup of that particular problem(Eg. 1st writeup name may be 1-Team1.md, and so on)
<br>Team Name/Username = Name of Team/Player who added the writeup.

Note : The user who makes the Pull Request bears the responsibility to make the PR merge-conflicts free.
