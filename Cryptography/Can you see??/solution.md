## Solution 

The title of this question "Can you see??" is the only hint you require to solve the question. Initially the text seems like some sort of manipulated hidden binary message and a
lot of player tried a lot of combinations to make it meaningful. To reach the solution answer the title question. If you answered "yes" then try a bunch of methods but what if the 
answer is "no". Then the questions becomes a bit interesting. Think a bit on the no part and then it should strike you that the 1 represents the dots and 0 represents the black spaces in the braille language. Now just open a online tool to convert the message into english and vola out pops the flag.
