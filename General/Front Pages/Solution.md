## Solution

<br>Searching for the Front Page of the Internet leads us to Reddit. And, searching for vishwaCTF on Reddit leads us to a user u/vishwaCTF, but the user has a blank profile without any posts. Lets check the comments, and sure enough we find just one comment stating that the user accidentally posted a flag on Reddit.

<br>Opening the comment however shows that the post has been deleted.

<br>But the comment also says that nothing on the Internet is ever deleted, so we just need to know how. This leads us to the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">WayBackMachine</a>.

<br>Here we try putting the link of the post and see that there's 2 snapshots that have been recorded for the given link on 26 Feb 2021.

<br>Opening the first one shows the contents of the post before it was deleted as follows:

<br>We see that the post has the flag in vishwaCTF{} format, but the test inside doesnt make any sense.

<br>However, there's a P.S. at the end of the post saying that 18th Century Scholars deserve more recognition. Searching for 18th Century Scholars in Cryptography gives us "Blaise de Vigen√®re".

<br>So we try to decode the message using <a href="https://cryptii.com/">Cryptii</a>'s Vignere Cipher Decoder. But, this needs a key.

<br>Trying the first most probable key of "vishwaCTF" we get the inner text as : {0$iNt_1s_oFT3n_0v3rL0okeD}
